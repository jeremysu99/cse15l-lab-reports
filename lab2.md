For both of these screenshots, the only methods called are the majn method and the handleRequest method within the ChatServer file.

The argument given to the main method is the port number, which is used to specify the port number where the server will be launched on, and both screenshots use port 4000.

The argument given to the handleRequest is the url of the page that is accessed. The two screenshots differ in their url because they contain different queries for their differing messages.

From both requests, the values for `URI url`, `String[] parameters`, `String message`, and `String user` all change because they describe the values within the url. When a new query is given, each of these values update accordingly.

## Part 3
