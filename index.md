Keys pressed: `<up><up><enter>`

Explanation: The `ssh j7su@ieng6.ucsd.edu` command was 2 up in my history, so I used the up arrow to access it followed by `<enter>` to run it. This connected me to the ieng6 terminal.

Step 5:

Keys pressed: `<up><up><up><up><up><up><up><enter>`

Explanation: The `git clone git@github.com:jeremysu99/lab7.git` command was 7 up in my history, so I used the up arrow to access it followed by `<enter>` to run it. This cloned the forked repository into my ieng6 machine from my GitHub account.

Step 6:

Keys pressed: `cd<space>l<tab><enter>`, `bash<space>t<tab><enter>`

Explanation: I typed out `cd l` followed with a `<tab>` to autofill the `cd lab7` command in order to change directories quickly. Then, I typed out `bash t` followed with a `<tab>` and an `<enter>` to autofill the `bash test.sh` command in order to run the tests quickly. This ran the bash script within the `lab7` directory to check which tests failed.

Step 7:

After changing `index1` to `index2`:

Exiting vim:

Result:

Keys pressed: `vim<space>L<tab>.<tab><enter>`, `G<up><up><up><up><up><up><up><up><up><up><up>f1r2:wq<enter>`

Explanation: I first typed out `vim L` followed by a `<tab>` to autofill the `ListExamples` name, followed by a `.` and another `<tab>` to autofill the `.java` part so that I could edit the `ListExamples.java` file with `vim`. After entering the text editor, I used the `<shift+g>` command to go to the bottom of the file, followed by 11 consecutive up arrows to position my cursor in the row I needed to edit. Then, I typed `f` followed by a `1` to jump to the next occurence of a `1`, which was at the 1 I needed to change to a 2. I then typed `r` followed by a `2` to replace the character under my cursor with a 2, effectively changing `index1` to `index2`. Finally, I exited and saved the file by typing `:wq` followed by an `<enter>`. This allowed me to edit the text within `ListExamples.java` to fix the error.

Keys pressed: `<up><up><enter>`

Explanation: the `bash test.sh` command was 2 commands up in my history, so I pressed the up arrow twice to access it followed by `<enter>` to run it. This again ran the bash script to see which tests failed.

Step 9:

Keys pressed: `<up><up><up><up><up><up><up><up><up><up><up><enter>`, `<up><up><up><up><up><up><up><up><up><up><up><enter>`, `<up><up><up><up><up><up><up><up><up><up><up><enter>`

Explanation: I first found the `git add ListExamples.java` command by going through my command history using the up arrow 11 times and pressing `<enter>` to run it. I then found the `git commit -m "Changed index1 to index2"` command by again going through my command history using the up arrow 11 times and pressing `<enter>` to run it. I lastly found the `git push origin main` command by going through my command history using the up arrow 11 times and pressing `<enter>` to run it. By executing these 3 commands, I added the changes made to the the staging area, I committed the changes to the local repository with a message, and I pushed the changes back to my forked repository in GitHub in the main branch.
